        <h1>Saturday, April 8, 2023</h1>
        <p>Today’s the first day of the blog, and so I figure I’ll treat this as the introduction of what this blog is all about. First of all, at the time of writing I’m hosting this on my personal website, although ‘hosting’ is probably the wrong word since this website isn’t actually on the internet, it’s just saved in a folder on my desktop. Maybe someday I’ll actually publish this, but if I do I doubt I’ll put it on the thesis website.</p>
        <p>The concept here is just a daily writing practice, and something that has no bearing on the thesis itself. I don’t anticipate that I’ll be writing every day, although knowing me I might write a lot of posts here in the early days just because of the initial enthusiasm. But this is here just so I can actually write something every day, and also so that I can somewhat regularly revisit the website, and by extension revisit the thesis. There’s a book that my partner gave me called Write Every Day that advocates for this practice of making sure that you write every single day. Hopefully most days you’ll be writing your thesis, but on the days where you don’t you can at least still have something to write. It keeps the motor running, and also provides an opportunity to vent when you need it. But it’s the venting thing that makes me wonder if this is actually something I’d want to post online.</p>
        <p>Back when I was a pastor (for what I now realize was an extremely brief period of time) I started to get into website creation then as well. I had indulged myself in an Adobe Creative Cloud account that had their full suite of apps, which meant I now had Dreamweaver. So at this time I made a personal website called caleb.me. And for this one I actually posted it online, buying the domain from GoDaddy and trying to do it all by hand (sort of). Since I was using Dreamweaver I didn’t actually have to do any coding, and I was just enjoying the artsy side of it. But it quickly became an avenue for venting about this ministry situation that was really draining me. I can’t remember what I was writing, but it was generally negative. I had a lot of frustration and angst and I just needed to get some of that out of my system.</p>
        <p>One Sunday I mentioned in a sermon that I had a website, just as an aside comment. I didn’t share the URL, and I only mentioned it as some sort of sermon illustration. (I should note that my sermons at the time were very impromptu – I was very unhappy being a pastor, and especially hated the tedium of sermon prep – so a lot of what I said on Sundays wound up being quite unguarded and poorly calculated.) After the sermon I remember a guy in the congregation who was quite tech-savvy showed me that he had found my website. As soon as I saw that I knew I had fumbled, and as soon as I got home I took the website down. And that killed the project for me.</p>
        <p>So we’ll see what happens with this. But for now, it’s just for me. Odds are this words won’t be read by anyone again, not even by me. But maybe someday.</p>
