            <p><em><strong>Thesis:</strong> There are certain themes in Wesley’s theology which were present throughout most of his life: free-will (Arminianism), assurance of salvation, and Christian perfection (sanctification). However, these doctrines received some subtle modifications in the latter half of Wesley’s life when he was introduced to the tripartite model of the image of God found in the works of Richard Baxter. Over time Wesley incorporated this understanding of the image of God into his theology, manifesting in an enhanced eschatology which Wesley called the New Creation. This thesis will examine these modifications in Wesley’s theology over the course of his career, giving special consideration to the ways in which Wesley incorporated the tripartite image into his thought to arrive at his theological vision.</em></p>

            <p>Abstract: The introduction will set the stage for the rest of the thesis. It will begin by making a case for the importance of the doctrine of the image of God in Wesley’s theology, stating that Wesley adopted and assimilated the tripartite formulation of the image later in his career. It will then summarise the three-part image as it appears in Wesley’s later writings. The chapter will then give an overview of some important theological and intellectual background, introducing themes that will be important later in the thesis. This will be followed by a review of four influential works on Wesley’s theology which also emphasise his anthropology. Finally, the introduction will conclude with an overview of the chapters to follow.</p>

            <h2>Introduction: The Importance of the image of God in Wesley’s theology</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Wesley’s later adoption of a three-part image and modification of crucial doctrines</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Introducing the Three-Part Image of God as it appears in Wesley</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Natural Image
                <ul>
                    <li>The part of the image that is often associated with the faculties of the soul. Wesley identified these as knowledge, will, and liberty, all three of them supported by a principle of self-motion.</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li>Moral Image
                <ul>
                    <li>The source of mankind’s holiness, the moral image perfects the natural image. This part of the image is often associated with the “righteousness and true holiness” of Ephesians 4:24.</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li>Political Image
                <ul>
                    <li>That by which mankind is considered the steward of creation, allowing humans to rule over the other creatures</li>
                    <li>Also, that by which some people may be able to rule over other people</li>
                    <li>Late in Wesley’s life it appears that he believed the political image to be a channel by which God’s grace is conveyed through humanity to the rest of creation.</li>
                </ul></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Theological and Intellectual Background</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Historical iterations of the Image of God
                <ul>
                    <li>A brief sketch of the various ways of speaking about the image of God, particularly in the Augustinian tradition of a psychological model of the image.</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li>The 3 Souls
                <ul>
                    <li>A short discussion of some historical understanding of the soul, particularly as the ideas of the 3 souls drawn from Aristotelian philosophy and how it relates to the natural image and the faculties of the soul.</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li>The Great Chain of Being
                <ul>
                    <li>This doctrine is relevant for Wesley’s later sermons in where his theological anthropology reaches its most ambitious levels of speculation. When Wesley considers the far-reaching effects of the renewal of the image of God, he appears to have the chain of being in mind. Therefore, it will be helpful to provide a summary of the doctrine.</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li>The Westminster Assembly
                <ul>
                    <li>The two catechisms, when speaking of the image of God, present three aspects of the image which correspond to the natural, moral, and political images. Furthermore, the supporting scriptures for this doctrine cited by the catechisms are those which are most often used by Wesley and others when speaking of the moral image and the human need to recover it. (Col. 3:10 and Eph. 4:24)</li>
                </ul></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Literature Review</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Randy Maddox,<em> Responsible Grace</em>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is considered one of the most important books in Wesley studies, arguing that the distinctive feature of Wesley’s theology is an understanding of grace as “responsible”, meaning that God’s grace requires a response on our part. Maddox further argues that Wesley came to this understanding through a subtle assimilation of Eastern theology.</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li>Kenneth Collins, <em>The Theology of John Wesley: Holy Love and the Shape of Grace</em>
                <ul>
                    <li>This book is considered, along with Maddox’s, as one of the mainstays of Wesleyan theology, and represents a side of debate between Maddox and Collins, particularly on the prominence of Eastern influence in Wesley’s theology. </li>
                </ul></li>
                <li>Theodore Runyon, <em>The New Creation</em>
                <ul>
                    <li>Runyon’s book is notable because it argues for the centrality of the image of God in Wesley’s theology, and even begins with an analysis of the tripartite image in Wesley’s theology. However, Runyon fails to give a thorough explanation for how this tripartite image factors into Wesley’s theology.</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li>Kevin Twain Lowery, <em>Salvaging Wesley’s Agenda: A New Paradigm for Wesleyan Virtue Ethics</em>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lowery brings a thorough philosophical lens to Wesley’s theology, arguing Aristotle was a foundational influence for Wesley. Lowery’s work includes an evaluation of Wesley’s anthropology, arguing for the incorporation of Kantian philosophy into our understanding of Wesley.</li>
                </ul></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Overview of the Chapters to Follow</h2>
        </section>
        <section class="ch1">
            <h1>Chapter 1: Some Crucial Influences: Richard Baxter, Isaac Watts, and Jonathan Edwards</h1>
            <p><em>Target Word Count: 10,000</em></p>
            <br>
            <p><em>Abstract: The chapter will evaluate the sources for Wesley’s understanding of the image of God. Wesley’s exposure to Baxter’s doctrine of the image of God at first came through other sources, and each time in such a way as to support other doctrinal arguments that were the subject of Wesley’s focus at the time (predestination, sanctification, and original sin). This chapter stands outside of the chronological flow of the rest of the thesis, emphasising the sources for a doctrine Wesley would not adopt until his mid-50s. Introducing these sources now enables further discussion later in the thesis regarding Wesley’s engagement with Watts and Edwards.</em></p>
            <br>
            <h2>Introduction: The need to identify Wesley’s sources for the tripartite image of God</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>This language of the image of God seems to almost appear out of nowhere in Wesley’s later works with little explanation. Therefore, an evaluation of the origin of this model of the image is needed.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Richard Baxter</h2>
            <ul>

                    <li>Synthesis: The Image of God
                    <ul>
                        <li>All of these characteristics are represented in a reduced form in Baxter’s understanding of the image of God. Most notably, the subsistential attributes each correspond to a part of the image: omnipotence to natural, omniscience to dominative, and benevolence to moral.</li>

            <h2>John Wesley’s Direct Sources for Baxter’s Theology</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>While Wesley was familiar with some of Baxter’s work, his first exposure to the doctrine seems to have come through a few other sources: Isaac Watts and Jonathan Edwards</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>

                    <li>Watts’s language change
                    <ul>
                        <li>Watts calls the third part of the image the ‘political image’ rather than the ‘dominative image’. This change will be evaluated.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                </ul></li>
                <li>Wesley’s Watts
                <ul>
                    <li>Wesley’s abridgments of Watts
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wesley includes an abridgement of sections from Watts’s <em>Ruin and Recovery</em> in his own response to John Taylor, 1757.</li>
                        <li>Wesley’s abridgment of question 13 from <em>Ruin and Recovery</em> in 1777.</li>
                        <li>Wesley publishes a serialised abridgment of Watts’s <em>Treatise on the Passions</em> in the <em>Arminian Magazine</em> in 1782-83.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                </ul></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Jonathan Edwards</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Introduction
                <ul>
                    <li>There are a handful of places where we see Edwards using language similar to that of Baxter regarding the image of God: <em>Religious Affections, Freedom of the Will, East of Eden</em> (sermon) and <em>The End for Which God Created the World</em></li>
                </ul></li>
                <li>A Summary of the Image of God in Edwards’s Writings
                <ul>
                    <li>Similar, but not the same
                    <ul>
                        <li>Generally, we only see Edwards talking about the ‘natural image’ and the ‘spiritual image’.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Edwards generally calls it the ‘spiritual image’ rather than the ‘moral image’</li>
                                <li>Edwards does not include a third part of the image</li>
                            </ul></li>
                        </ul></li>
                    </ul></li>
                <li>Edwards and Baxter
                <ul>
                    <li>Edwards’s father instructed him in Puritan writings from a very early age, including works by Baxter</li>
                    <li>Edwards read <em>The Practical Works of Richard Baxter</em>, which contained <em>Reasons of the Christian Religion</em> and <em>The Divine Life in Three Treatises,</em> both of which incorporate the three-part image.</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li>Wesley’s Use of Edwards
                <ul>
                    <li>Wesley’s 5 abridgement of Edwards’s <em>Religious Affections</em></li>
                    <li>Wesley’s <em>Thoughts Upon Necessity</em>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This was, in part, a response to Edwards’s <em>Free Will</em>.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                </ul></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Conclusion: Wesley’s adoption of Baxter’s doctrine</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Wesley was primarily introduced to this doctrine by intermediaries who did not incorporate Baxter’s trinitarian logic. Therefore, Wesley also did not incorporate the trinitarian logic that underpins the tripartite image.</li>
            </ul>
